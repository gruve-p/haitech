Implement the AES-128 block cipher encryption function.
The official specifications of AES
are available in FIPS Publication 197. You need to implement encryption with a 128-bit key
only. Parts of the code (S-box and round constant tables, xtime() macro for multiplication
in GF(2^8)) are already provided in aes128e.c.

The appendices of the specifications include test vectors that you can use for debugging.
The first input set used by the provided driver (aes128e_driver.c) is the one given in
Appendix A.1 and B.
