Implement Grøstl-256 hash function. Grøstl is one of the five finalists of the ongoing SHA-3 hash function competition and it can very well become the next "AES" of hash functions. Specifications are available in the document submitted to the SHA-3 competition. The specifications include many variants of Grøstl but implement only the variant with 64-byte (512-bit) blocks and 32-byte (256-bit) hashes, that is, Grøstl-256. It can be assumed that the message length is a multiple of 8 bits (one byte). A simple function performing the message padding of Grøstl is provided in groestl256.c.
