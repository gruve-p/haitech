Given a currency with denominations of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 1 write a method MakeChange that takes an integer amount representing the total change to make and return an integer representing the smallest possible number of bills to return.  For example a call of MakeChange(135) would result in a return value of 4 (1 one hundred bill, 1 twenty bill, 1 ten bill and 1 five bill).
